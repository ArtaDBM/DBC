Amid the chaos of the First War, the mines were abandoned and later thought to be haunted, leaving them relatively untouched until the Defias Brotherhood--a group of former laborers turned brigands--claimed the labyrinth as a base of operations for its subversive activities against Stormwind."

Sinister forces occupy these ruins, formerly the dwelling of the mad archmage Arugal\'s worgen. The restless shade of Baron Silverlaine lingers, while Lord Godfrey and his cabal of erstwhile Gilnean noblemen plot against their enemies both living and undead."

A vital hub of this shadow network is Blackrock Caverns, site of the cult\'s blistering forge and some of its most heinous experiments, including the transformation of cultists into twilight dragonkin."
67	725	5303	522360	522344	526412	518	"The Stonecore"	"Within the Temple of Earth, locked in the heart of Deepholm, lies the Stonecore. It was inside these caverns that the Twilight\'s Hammer toiled over Deathwing, hammering elementium plates to the Dragon Aspect\'s body in an attempt to hold his tormented form together.

Its elegant structures, crowned with bronze and gold, sit atop platforms bridged by pure air.

Rumors abound that the complex also contains a devastating weapon capable of reordering all life on Azeroth.

Thus far the facility\'s communication systems have been fully corrupted, but the weapon inside continues to elude Deathwing\'s grasp."

Once the stronghold of the Wildhammer dwarves, and later seized by orcs as a prison for Alextrasza, the city is now in the clutches of the Twilight\'s Hammer cult.
