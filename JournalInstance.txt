63	36	1581	522352	522336	526404	Deadmines	It is said the Deadmines\' gold deposits once accounted for a third of Stormwind\'s treasure reserves. Amid the chaos of the First War, the mines were abandoned and later thought to be haunted, leaving them relatively untouched until the Defias Brotherhood--a group of former laborers turned brigands--claimed the labyrinth as a base of operations for its subversive activities against Stormwind.
64	33	0	522358	522342	526410	Shadowfang Keep	Looming over Pyrewood Village from the southern bluffs of Silverpine Forest, Shadowfang Keep casts a shadow as dark as its legacy. Sinister forces occupy these ruins, formerly the dwelling of the mad archmage Arugal\'s worgen. The restless shade of Baron Silverlaine lingers, while Lord Godfrey and his cabal of erstwhile Gilnean noblemen plot against their enemies both living and undead.
65	643	5382	522362	522346	526413	Throne of the Tides	Deep within the Abyssal Maw\'s fathomless expanses lies the Throne of the Tides. From here, the great elemental lord Neptulon the Tidehunter has surveyed and protected his aquatic domain for ages. He now faces his greatest challenge as a force of serpentine naga and malefic faceless ones threaten to depose him, leaving his realm and its secrets ripe for the plundering.
66	645	5374	522350	522334	526402	Blackrock Caverns	Rumors suggest that Deathwing himself carved out the subterranean labyrinth that allows the Twilight\'s Hammer to secretly transport elementals from the majestic Mount Hyjal to Blackrock Mountain. A vital hub of this shadow network is Blackrock Caverns, site of the cult\'s blistering forge and some of its most heinous experiments, including the transformation of cultists into twilight dragonkin.
67	725	5303	522360	522344	526412	The Stonecore	Within the Temple of Earth, locked in the heart of Deepholm, lies the Stonecore. It was inside these caverns that the Twilight\'s Hammer toiled over Deathwing, hammering elementium plates to the Dragon Aspect\'s body in an attempt to hold his tormented form together. With his renewal complete, Deathwing ascended into Azeroth, shattering the World Pillar and destabilizing the region of Deepholm.
68	657	5583	522361	522345	526414	The Vortex Pinnacle	The Vortex Pinnacle exists within the elemental plane of Skywall. Its elegant structures, crowned with bronze and gold, sit atop platforms bridged by pure air. Yet behind its exterior beauty, the pinnacle harbors Neferset tol\'vir, as well as Al\'Akir the Windlord\'s merciless elemental legions. As long as the barrier between Skywall and Azeroth remains open, terror will rain down on Uldum from the skies.
69	755	0	522357	522341	526409	Lost City of the Tol\'vir	The Lost City of the Tol\'vir is the stronghold of the Neferset, a faction of the cat-like tol\'vir who swore fealty to Deathwing in exchange for a cure to the curse of flesh, which had turned their rocky hides to soft skin. With the affliction expunged, the tol\'vir have rebelled against their benefactor, although they remain irrevocably twisted and hostile due to the dark pact that they made.
70	644	0	522356	522340	526408	Halls of Origination	Constructed by the great titans, the Halls of Origination are filled with ancient relics and the fearsome guardians that protect them. Rumors abound that the complex also contains a devastating weapon capable of reordering all life on Azeroth. Deathwing has moved to obtain this terrifying device through his agent, Al\'Akir the Windlord. Thus far the facility\'s communication systems have been fully corrupted, but the weapon inside continues to elude Deathwing\'s grasp.
71	670	0	522354	522338	526406	Grim Batol	"Don\'t be fooled by Grim Batol\'s humble exterior; many of this mountain fortress\'s desecrated chambers are buried deep in the Twilight Highlands. Once the stronghold of the Wildhammer dwarves, and later seized by orcs as a prison for Alextrasza, the city is now in the clutches of the Twilight\'s Hammer cult.

Heroes brave enough to infiltrate the brooding depths of the stronghold must confront Deathwing\'s agents to thwart the mysterious evil within."
72	671	0	522355	522339	526407	The Bastion of Twilight	The Bastion of Twilight stands as a dark symbol of the Old Gods\' burgeoning power on Azeroth. Various branches of the Twilight\'s Hammer dwell deep beneath the towering form--considered the cult\'s foremost command center--along with their twisted leader, Cho\'gall. There, he and his servants conspire to bring the Old Gods\' apocalyptic visions to fruition by bleeding Azeroth of all sanity, hope, and life.
73	669	5729	522351	522335	526403	Blackwing Descent	Nefarian and his warped attempts to create a new breed of dragon were thought to be defeated after his death in Blackwing Lair. Yet tales have emerged that his father, Deathwing, has reanimated  Nefarian and set him to work in Blackwing Descent. The gruesome experiments being conducted there are feared to be on a level of wickedness far surpassing Nefarian\'s previous crimes against nature.
74	754	5684	522359	522343	526411	Throne of the Four Winds	Al\'Akir the Windlord\'s personal lair, the Throne of the Four Winds, glides high among Skywall\'s boundless vistas. Now that the barriers of the Elemental Plane have been ruptured, Al\'Akir is free to travel Azeroth\'s winds at his leisure. He has mustered his fiercest tempests to scour Uldum of life and seize control of the mysterious titan-forged Halls of Origination.
75	757	0	522349	522333	526401	Baradin Hold	Following the Second War, the ruined fortress of Baradin Hold on the remote island of Tol Barad was converted into a prison for some of the most dangerous forces on Azeroth. Yet with the devastation wrought by the Cataclysm, the prison\'s integrity has been compromised. Now as the Horde and Alliance vie for supremacy on the island, the liberation of its forgotten horrors may be at hand.
76	859	0	522364	522348	526416	Zul\'Gurub	Zul\'Gurub was the capital of the Gurubashi jungle trolls, a tribe that once controlled the vast jungles of the south. It was here that Jin\'do the Hexxer summoned the savage loa Hakkar the Soulflayer into Azeroth. Of late, these efforts have begun anew amid an alliance between the Gurubashi and Zandalar trolls that seeks to establish a unified troll empire.
77	568	3508	522363	522347	526415	Zul\'Aman	Echoes of unfulfilled vengeance linger in the one-time capital of the Amani tribe, Zul\'Aman. Though the Amani trolls answered their warlord\'s call to arms, Zul\'jin was denied his goal of restoring the empire to its former glory. Where he failed, the Zandalar tribe will succeed. Left unchecked, the united tribes will reclaim their lands and savor a merciless retribution.
78	720	0	522353	522337	526405	Firelands	The Firelands is the molten domain forged by the titans to house Ragnaros and his wayward minions. Following Deathwing\'s emergence into Azeroth, Ragnaros and his servants surged onto the slopes of Mount Hyjal before being driven back by the sacred mountain\'s valiant defenders. Now Ragnaros is rallying his loyalists to defend the Firelands from Azeroth\'s champions.
184	938	0	571754	571739	571758	End Time	One of an infinite number of potential outcomes, this timeway depicts the desolate future of Azeroth should Deathwing fail to be stopped.  Nozdormu has identified a powerful anomaly that exists in this moment and bars access to the past - and hope of retrieving the Demon Soul. The powerful creature from out of time lives alone amidst the time-twisted echoes of the past.
185	939	0	571756	571741	571760	Well of Eternity	Ten-thousand years in the past, the night elven capital city of Zin-Azshari was a magnificent, sparkling metropolis.  Situated on the shores of the Well of Eternity, it was here that the aristocratic Highborne first opened a portal into the Twisting Nether and invited the Burning Legion to invade Azeroth.  Under the command of the night elven queen, Azshara, they now pour their energies into the portal, preparing it for the terrifying and glorious entrance of the demon god Sargeras.
186	940	0	571755	571740	571759	Hour of Twilight	With the Dragon Soul retrieved from the past, the Heroes of Azeroth now prepare for the final confrontation with Deathwing.  In the frozen wastes of Northrend, the towering spire of Wyrmrest Temple is under the assault of Deathwing\'s Twilight forces.  In order to save Azeroth, Thrall must arrive safely at the temple with the Dragon Soul in hand.
187	967	0	571753	571738	571757	Dragon Soul	Forged by Deathwing during the War of the Ancients, the Dragon Soul harnessed the combined power of the dragonflights until it was ultimately destroyed. Through the Caverns of Time, Thrall and the remaining dragonflights were able to recover the powerful artifact before its destruction.  Now they have rallied at Wyrmrest Temple in a desperate attempt to use the might of the Dragon Soul against Deathwing himself.

In recent years, several of the instructors have changed, but the institution remains under the control of Darkmaster Gandling, a particularly sadistic and insidious practitioner of necromantic magic.

303	962	0	521746	521743	527422	Gate of the Setting Sun	For generations, a massive wall called the Serpent\'s Spine has protected the denizens of Pandaria from periodic assaults by the rampaging, insect-like mantid. This brutal race\'s cycle of aggression recently began earlier than expected, catching the wall\'s defenders off guard. As the mightiest mantid warriors charge the battle-worn gates, Pandaria must hold back the most devastating army in the land\'s recorded history.
311	1001	0	608214	608175	608253	Scarlet Halls	The Crusade\'s fiercest warriors, those who have held their ground and fought to defend the monastery throughout these dark times, are rapidly preparing an army within the Scarlet Halls. These soldiers are bound by their hatred of the unliving, and they are willing to sacrifice everything for their order\'s righteous cause.
312	959	0	521746	521743	527422	Shado-Pan Monastery	War has spread across Pandaria, and the destructive conflict between the Horde and Alliance has led to turmoil in the majestic Shado-pan Monastery. There, three malevolent entities--the Sha of Violence, the Sha of Hatred, and the Sha of Anger--have erupted from their prisons. Although the Sha of Anger fled the secluded monastery completely, the remaining sha have begun wreaking havoc on the site\'s brave Shado-pan defenders.
313	960	0	521746	521743	527422	Temple of the Jade Serpent	Rising high above the east coast of Pandaria, the Temple of the Jade Serpent stands as a sacred monument to the legendary pandaren emperor Shao Hao\'s victory over the Sha of Doubt thousands of years ago.

316	1004	0	608214	608175	608253	Scarlet Monastery	The Crusade\'s fanatical leaders direct their followers from the Scarlet Cathedral, at the heart of the monastery grounds. This heavily guarded location functions as the order\'s headquarters, and some of the most zealous and intolerant crusaders roam the halls of this once-hallowed place.
317	1008	0	521746	521743	527422	Mogu\'shan Vaults	The mogu, proud of their supremacy, kept lengthy records of their accomplishments within a great complex of vaults. Guarded by ferocious magical beings, these sacred chambers have remained silent since the mogu\'s departure.
320	996	0	521746	521743	527422	Terrace of Endless Spring	Straddling the mountain range between the Jade Forest and the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, the Terrace of Endless Spring has been a sacred refuge for millennia.

321	994	0	521746	521743	527422	Mogu\'shan Palace	The ancient Mogu\'shan Palace is the last true bastion of the mogu\'s strength. Three of their great clans recently gathered at this stunning location to meet with their king, Xin the Weaponmaster. This mighty ruler has formulated a bold plan to unite his scattered people and reclaim the glory of their fallen empire. With turmoil gripping Pandaria, Xin\'s lofty dream of conquest could become reality.
322	996	0	521746	521743	527422	Pandaria	Shrouded in fog since the world was sundered more than ten thousand years ago, the ancient realm of Pandaria has remained unspoiled by war. Its lush forests and cloud-ringed mountains are home to a complex ecosystem of indigenous races and exotic creatures. It is the homeland of the enigmatic Pandaren, a race that celebrates life to the fullest even while under siege by an ancient menace.
324	1011	0	521746	521743	527422	Siege of Niuzao Temple	Niuzao Temple extends across two fortified islands far beyond a towering wall called the Serpent\'s Spine. For years, tenacious pandaren defenders have protected the narrow bridges connecting the isles, staving off any would-be invaders. Yet recently, the mantid created their own bridge--a massive tree root--and seized one of the islands by surprise. Now, these brutal insectoids are poised to assault Niuzao\'s remaining guardians.
330	1009	0	521746	521743	527422	Heart of Fear	The Sha of Fear has corrupted the grand empress of the mantid. Her increasingly erratic and paranoid commands have driven the Klaxxi--the keepers of mantid culture--to take aggressive action. Because they are few in number, the Klaxxi are reluctantly willing to accept outside help in destroying the empress and purging their race of the sha\'s negative influence.
