Serving as the chief hunter and kennel master of Ragnaros\'s hell hounds, Shannox patrols the elemental realm with his two most ferocious beasts: Riplimb and Rageface.
196	0	800	0.4950096	0.3098805	2590	78	5	-17	Baleroc, the Gatekeeper	Baleroc earned a reputation as a merciless combatant during the elemental wars of ancient Azeroth. Now that he is confined to the Firelands, Baleroc\'s sanity has dwindled. Few elementals dare disturb him, fearful that they will become victim to his battle lust.
197	466	800	0.5099801	0.724551	2911	78	6	-17	Majordomo Staghelm	The loss of his son, Valstann, in the War of the Shifting Sands utterly shattered Fandral Staghelm\'s spirit. Now empowered by Ragnaros as the new Majordomo of the Firelands (replacing the deceased Majordomo Executus) and the leader of the treacherous Druids of the Flame, Fandral seeks to bring ruin to Azeroth rather than live in a world without his beloved child.
198	466	800	0.5099801	0.1556885	2629	78	7	-17	Ragnaros	Ragnaros, lord of the Firelands, embodies the fury and destruction of the primordial infernos that forged Azeroth itself. Promised the chance to set Azeroth aflame without interference from Neptulon and Therazane, Ragnaros seeks to appease the Old Gods by incinerating the World Tree of Nordrassil.
283	498	820	0.515514	0.433775	3667	184	4	-1	Echo of Tyrande	Once the leader of the night elves and High Priestess of Elune, this time-twisted fragment of Tyrande Whisperwind now wanders the wastes of the desolate future of Azeroth. Enveloped in a perpetual midnight, she has all but lost sight of the comforting light of Elune.
285	495	820	0.495389	0.660817	3641	184	2	-1	Echo of Jaina	The tormented fragment of Jaina Proudmoore has been split and infused within the shattered pieces of her staff. To restore balance to the timeways, this echo must be defeated. However, the devastating magical power possessed by the once-proud ruler of Theramore is hardly lost to her time-havocked spectre. In this future Azeroth, she is only divided, and waiting...
289	499	820	0.484811	0.323013	3675	184	5	-1	Murozond	Now living outside of time, Murozond was once the great Dragon Aspect Nozdormu the Timeless One. After the titans showed him his own death, the tormented Nozdormu was tricked by the Old Gods into trying to subvert his mortality. As a result, Nozdormu shattered the timeways and created the Infinite Dragonflight... jeopardizing the very future of Azeroth.
290	0	816	0.237485	0.482577	4164	185	1	-1	Peroth\'arn	"Like many of his fellow Highborne, Peroth\'arn swore allegiance to the corrupted Xavius in exchange for gifts of demonic power. 

As a master of fiendish magic and recipient of the satyr curse, Peroth\'arn stands outside Azshara\'s palace in defense of the Burning Legion, ready to destroy those hoping to disrupt the entrance of the Dark Titan, Sargeras, into Azeroth."
291	0	816	0.463389	0.369625	3968	185	2	-1	Queen Azshara	The songs of Queen Azshara\'s beauty, majesty, and power are too numerous to count, but it was her vanity that drove the Highborne to summon the Burning Legion. She now watches her most trusted magi empower the portal where Sargeras will be brought into Azeroth, content to let multitudes of her servants die in advance of the Dark Titan\'s arrival.
292	0	816	0.873028	0.482577	3684	185	3	-1	Mannoroth and Varo\'then	Varo\'then, head of Queen Azshara\'s personal guard, and Mannoroth, the pit lord whose blood will corrupt the entire orc race, stand as the last line of defense against those hoping to bar Sargeras\'s entry into Azeroth. Though both Tyrande and Illidan have fought bravely thus far, the fate of Azeroth will be decided at the Well of Eternity\'s very brink.
311	0	824	0.503996	0.692524	3879	187	1	-1	Morchok	The most powerful elemental still under Deathwing\'s sway, Morchok-once a passive guardian-is now convinced that his only respite will come with Azeroth\'s demise. Morchok rages against the foundation of Wyrmrest Temple, Azeroth\'s last beacon of hope in the Hour of Twilight.
317	505	824	0.527504	0.520451	3912	187	4	-1	Hagara the Stormbinder	Hagara, one of the first students of arcane magic under the Forsaken, showed surprising potential for one who had started learning so late in life. But in her undisciplined attempts to bind elementals into servitude, she was ensnared and twisted by the Windlord, Al\'Akir. Now fiercely loyal to the Twilight\'s Hammer, Hagara binds others for her elemental masters to torment.
318	513	824	0.332957	0.850192	4050	187	7	-1	Spine of Deathwing	When Deathwing first channeled the Dragon Soul\'s power against the other flights, the massive energies that were unleashed threatened to break apart his very body.  Rather than forgo this weapon, he had adamantium plates fused to his scales to hold his body together. Later reinforced with elementium, these plates are now his weakness--the sole vulnerability to Deathwing\'s lethal presence.

322	0	819	0.567376	0.277179	3942	186	1	-1	Arcurion	Horde and Alliance assaults against the Twilight\'s Hammer have slaughtered many of the cult\'s fearsome elemental ascendants. One exception is Arcurion, a formidable ice ascendant tasked to slay Thrall and retrieve the Dragon Soul. Should this twisted elemental being succeed, nothing will be able to stop Deathwing from ushering in the Hour of Twilight.
323	496	820	0.559097	0.392068	3955	184	3	-1	Echo of Sylvanas	Spawned from shattered timeways and cloistered within the Ruby Dragonshrine, a maddened fragment of the Forsaken\'s leader, Sylvanas Windrunner, waits restlessly. Having lost everything and unable to find peace, this tormented echo aches for a chance to unleash her dark fury at anything still living within these barren, time-twisted wastes.
324	503	824	0.509638	0.530325	3970	187	2	-1	Warlord Zon\'ozz	Countless ages ago, Warlord Zon\'ozz and his soldiers waged endless war against the forces of C\'Thun and Yogg-Saron. Millennia have passed, but the warlord still serves the chaotic might of the Old God N\'Zoth. Deathwing has now unleashed this legendary faceless one to crush the defenders of Wyrmrest Temple.
325	504	824	0.468265	0.499295	3974	187	3	-1	Yor\'sahj the Unsleeping	Since the fall of the Bastion of Twilight, Yor\'sahj the Unsleeping has eagerly assisted Deathwing, providing the Destroyer with the means to release more faceless ones from their prisons deep beneath the earth. Their numbers are endless and their power is beyond reckoning, and Yor\'sahj intends to reap a grim reward for his faithful service.
331	0	824	0.500329	0.45809	4247	187	5	-1	Ultraxion	More an abomination of dark energy than a dragon, Ultraxion has spent his short life absorbing the essence of captured nether dragons. Ultraxion is the only twilight dragon Deathwing has praised, and his arrogance is overshadowed only by the crackling energies surging through his twisted form. Loyal to his master, Ultraxion swears to bring about the fall of Wyrmrest Temple.
332	512	824	0.481521	0.171771	4027	187	6	-1	Warmaster Blackhorn	Though once vast in number, only a few dozen twilight dragons now remain. Astride these hardened survivors are the last vestiges of the Twilight\'s Hammer\'s army: the elite drake riders of Deathwing\'s personal escort. Led by the insidious Warmaster Blackhorn, they move with unholy purpose, driven to protect their dark master.
333	514	824	0.478702	0.538485	4040	187	8	-1	Madness of Deathwing	A warped mass of molten hatred and unfathomable power, this formless, mindless horror cannot be stopped. Whatever was left of Neltharion the Earth-Warder is long gone, his mind and soul corrupted and devoured by his Old God masters. All this monstrous being desires is destruction, annihilation, and the end of all things.

339	252	752	0.479042	0.179641	4120	75	3	-17	Alizabal, Mistress of Hate	The Kirin Tor imprisoned Alizabal in their formidable Violet Hold not long after corrupt magi summoned the shivarra into Azeroth. Despite arcane wards restricting her powers, the demon\'s malicious influence alone caused her guards to murder one another in sudden fits of rage. Her transfer to Baradin Hold prior to the Cataclysm has only aggravated the ruined prison\'s increasingly dire conditions.
340	497	820	0.367197	0.530952	4138	184	1	-1	Echo of Baine	Enraged by his failure to protect the world and, most importantly, the Horde, this time-ravaged shade of Baine Bloodhoof lingers within the ruins of the Obsidian Dragonshrine. Although he\'s still as powerful as the tauren high chieftain from the present, within this shattered future Azeroth, this guilt-ridden echo is little more than a discordant vessel of unquenchable malice and anger.
341	502	819	0.473824	0.513754	4150	186	3	-1	Archbishop Benedictus	Archbishop Benedictus is the revered leader of the Church of the Holy Light. For years, his wise guidance has been instrumental in seeing humanity through bleak times. Yet beneath his apparent benevolence lies the shocking truth that Benedictus has pledged himself to the eradication of all life on Azeroth through the agency of his dark master... Deathwing.
342	0	819	0.407704	0.509356	4167	186	2	-1	Asira Dawnslayer	Former blade-for-hire Asira Sunbright was initially leery of working for the Twilight\'s Hammer, but the cult\'s generous payments quickly won her over. In time, she succumbed to the corruptive influence of her dark employers, even going so far as to take the name Dawnslayer. As one of the cult\'s deadliest assassins, Asira has been called upon to exterminate Thrall and his comrades.
